    What are Web Worker ?
        It is Background threads in the browser.
    
    There are 2 types of Webworker -
        a) Dedicated - Dedicated worker is linked to the browser window that spawned the worker, 
                       so it has a very tight relationship with that window.
        b) Shared - A Shared worker is a worker which runs in the background and basically 
                    any script that is running within that domain can send message to the worker.
        
        Shared workers are largely unimplemented in browser nowadays. So we will talk about Dedicated workers only.

        Restrictions - 
            a) No Access to DOM
            b) No access to Window
            c) No access to host page
        Our favuirate Javascript libarary may not work with the worker.EX. JQuery, Angualr etc..
