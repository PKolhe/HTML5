    What are Offline Applications ?

        Web => Web Application

        We need internet connectivity in order to work web application work correctly.
        It takes roundtrip requests to and from the server in order to work site correctly.

        When we are in the situation where Internet connectivity is lost, 
        then Web application execution gets stopped.

        Web =>  ###  => Offline Application

        So, idea behind the Offline Applications is that instead of operating like a standard web
        application, offline application will continue to work even if there is no internet connectivity.
        The files that are needed in order to get certain parts of the application working correctly
        are copied down into the users computer and  saved in place where those files can be reliably retrieved.

        Often with web applications we need access to services, databases, and other parts of applications 
        so offline apps attempt to takje of as much as it can but there are certain exclusions withing 
        the architecture of offline applications.

    What are Offline Applications in terms of technical ?

        Offline Applications are marriage of two pieces of technology one that is been supported 
        within browser quite a while.

        Browser Events + Applications Cache

        So first thing we need to do is to build our application which wil lrespond to the online & offline 
        browser events. So there are events that are fired when the browser recognises that its online or 
        offline from the web and even there is boolean property we can check to find out whether user 
        if online or offline.

        Here is also HTML5 new feature available that is Application Cache. 
        Application Cache comes with series of its own events and series of its  own construction in order 
        again to make that page into users computer where pages can be served reliably over and over again.
        And So idea is that this in contrast to regular browser caching where if we disconnect from the web 
        and we try to refresh on the normal page we might get content of that page but images won't show up, 
        CSS won't often show up and we will have different broken areas.

        Application Cache gives us the opportunity again reliably serve up the even when we are not connected
        to the web.

        b) Assets
        c) Application Cache
        d) Online status Awareness
